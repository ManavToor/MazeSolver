<h1>Maze Solver</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Wanted to learn more about algorithms so I watched some youtube videos about maze solvers. This is a simple code that uses Breadth First Search (BFS) to solve a maze
<br />
<br />
<b>This is maze solver:</b><br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-solves maze using breadth-first-search<br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-maze is in code<br /><br />

<br />
I followed a tutorial but I did make some modifications to help the code run faster and be more visually apealing<br />

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 

<h2>Output:</h2>
